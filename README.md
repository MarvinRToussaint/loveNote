This program was inspired by the TV show imposters.

#The Inspiration
One night I was watching the TV show "Imposters" with my girlfriend.
In the movie conartist the feds have been tracking sent a card with a website to one of the agents.
Once the agent surfed to the website he was met with a simple webpage that just had a colorful,
background and a button in the middle that said click.

The website played a secret video message left by the purp, and then there was a dummy video loaded so you could
only watch it once.

I just started to learn HTML CSS and JS and as soon as I saw it. I thought I could recreate it from scratch,
but have it created for the love of my life. It's crazy how I had just an idea in my head, and then was able to put it
into practice, and create something that she'll be able to access for ever.

##The program

The program is simple. I have 2 HTML files with stylized buttons *feel free to adjust to your preference* that have videos loaded on them. With JavaScript I was able to interact with click of the button, and also set up a video for when the video ends, so it loads the 2nd HTML page with the dummy video. 

I used pandas's alot because my girlfriend loves pandas, but you can customize it to make it fit your purpose!
